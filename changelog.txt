* Small changes and fixes
	- Fixed the previous and next page buttons that were missing from the ticket window.
	- Double click the window title to reset it to it's default position.
	- Made the text at the bottom of the ticket window a button (doesn't look like one but it is!). You can use it to easily turn offlines tickets on and off.
	- Changed the spy window to show more detailed location information and include the player's phase (if online).
	- Changed the (Un)root button from a secure button to a normal button and named in (Un)freeze. Now also works for players not in range and offline players. Also added freeze and unfreeze to the quick commands menu.

0.3.1
* Small changes and fixes
	- Fixed a bug where dropdowns were loaded before checking saved variables, resulting in LUA errors is the defaults needed to be loaded.

0.3
* Major visible changes:
	- Added several quick commands (revive, appear, summon, spy) on right clicking someone's name.
	- Added mail macros.
	- Added dropdowns for mail and whisper macros when spying someone and when right clicking a name in the game.
* Small changes and fixes
	- Changed the regular expression to read ticket listings and tickets from chat, so that it now allows spaces in the created and last modified time (this will make the addon work on new TC revisions).
	- Fixed a bug where tickets with an empty line at the start would not display correctly.
	- All regular expressions and functions to read from chat moved to Chatreader.lua.
	- Load saved variabled in Savedvariables.lua and allow setting defaults in that file (this allows creating a default preset for a server-specific distribution of GM Genie).
	- Big code cleanup in several areas. Consistent naming for variables and functions, as far as possible without creating unnescessary extra variables.
